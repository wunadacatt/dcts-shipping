# Heads Up Socket Documentation

To avoid some confusion i want to clarify some things and explain the basic setting that this documentation is in. If you still have questions or anything feel free to contact me or the community. Relevant links can be found inside the repo readme file or on github itself.

## Some facts

1. DCTS uses socket.io, which is basically a library built on top of websockets, meaning its not directly compatible with websockets. Here's a list of implementations: https://socket.io/docs/v4/
2. All code examples will be shown in javascript or nodejs (client/server)

Thats all you need to know for now!
