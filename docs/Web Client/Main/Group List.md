# Group List

Every instance can have multiple groups that can be used to better organize yourself and or your team or any other use case you can think of. Every group will have their own channels, icon, banner and permissions and while it may seem like a server list, it is not.

**Here are possible use cases for groups:**

- You could make a group for your staff members to better organize and keeping things from being messy
- If you want to run a general community, you could create a group for each topic, like anime, music, gaming, etc..
- You could give friends admin permissions so that they could add some roles and a group for themselves rather than hosting their own instance.

While groups have their own permissions, they all share and derive from the server roles. Generally speaking, channel permissions overwrite group permissions, and group permissions overwrite server role permissions. Its important to keep in mind that groups are not fully isolated from the instance, which makes it less ideal to be used "as server", as groups cannot have their own roles as of the time of writing, and its currently not planned to change.
