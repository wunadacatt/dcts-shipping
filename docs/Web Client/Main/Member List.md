# Member List

The member list will show all members that have access to the channel you're currently viewing. Admins can configure the member list to automatically filter out accounts that have been offline for a specific amount of time. This will avoid having to go through dead accounts when looking for a member and saves performance as well.

## Timeout Setting

The timeout setting can be found inside the `configs/config.json` file, as there is no setting yet inside the UI, because of the time of writing it is planned to rework the settings pages.
