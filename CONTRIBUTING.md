## Design Philosophy

In order to best contribute to DCTS in form of code its important to understand how DCTS is being developed and the goals behind it. 

1. DCTS is avoiding as many 3rd party libraries as possible with the goal to be as independent as possible. A lot of libraries are custom-made to provide long term stability as DCTS was made with the intent to exist for a long time to come.
2. Keep everything as simple as possible. This includes code as well as UI flows. ***Everything*** should be as simple and intuitive as possible and avoid over-engineering.
3. AI usage to write anything more than maybe an function should be avoided as such code can be a pain to maintain etc

## Working on Code

In order to keep things organized and free of conflicts we need to set some standards.

1. **Use the issue**s and mark it so that people know that you already **work** on it.
2. **Dont work on stuff randomly**. Make an issue for it and wait until it gets approved. Changes or features wont be accepted if not approved beforehand. Otherwise feel free to make plugins.
3. **Keep your changes to only the specific area** and approved topics! If you work on the theme handling, dont edit things from the message system. PRs with multiple changes will be rejected.
